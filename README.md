## Iron App of Valhalla
### Infinity Engine audio exploration


#### A macOS application for exploring the music, voices, and sounds of Infinity Engine games like _Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition_, _Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition_, and _Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition_.

Available on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iron-app-of-valhalla/id1464598047).

Released under the MIT license.
